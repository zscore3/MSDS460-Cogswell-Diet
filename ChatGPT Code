#To solve the given minimization problem using the PuLP package in Python, you can follow the steps below. This code defines the optimization problem, adds the necessary constraints, and solves for the minimal cost.
#
#Make sure you have the PuLP package installed. You can install it using pip if you haven't done so already:
#
#bash
#Copy code
#pip install pulp
#Here's the Python code to set up and solve the problem:
#
#python
#Copy code
import pulp

# Create a linear programming problem
problem = pulp.LpProblem("Minimize_Cost", pulp.LpMinimize)

# Define decision variables
CVTP = pulp.LpVariable('CVTP', lowBound=0)  # Continuous variable for CVTP
CHKN = pulp.LpVariable('CHKN', lowBound=0)  # Continuous variable for CHKN
RICE = pulp.LpVariable('RICE', lowBound=0)  # Continuous variable for RICE
SLMN = pulp.LpVariable('SLMN', lowBound=0)  # Continuous variable for SLMN
MASH = pulp.LpVariable('MASH', lowBound=0)  # Continuous variable for MASH

# Objective function: Minimize cost
problem += 10 * CVTP + 10 * CHKN + 10 * RICE + 10 * SLMN + 10 * MASH, "Total_Cost"

# Constraints
problem += (980 * CVTP + 920 * CHKN + 880 * RICE + 850 * SLMN + 770 * MASH <= 5000 * 7, "Sodium_Constraint")

#Explanation:
#Problem Definition: We define the linear programming problem as a minimization problem.
#
#Decision Variables: Five decision variables (CVTP, CHKN, RICE, SLMN, MASH) are defined, all with a lower bound of 0.
#
#Objective Function: The objective is to minimize the total cost, which is the sum of the decision variables multiplied by their costs.
#
#Constraints: Each constraint is added according to the problem statement.
#
#Solving the Problem: The solve() method is called to find the optimal solution.
#
#Results: Finally, we print the status of the solution, the optimal cost, and the values of each decision variable.
#
#You can run this code in a Python environment, and it will output the optimal solution to your problem.
#
#
##Secondary Prompt provided here:
#You said:
#Provide code to do the same to minimize "Energy" while ignoring "Total_Cost"
#ChatGPT said:
#ChatGPT
#To modify the previous code to minimize "Energy" instead of "Total Cost," you can redefine the objective function. Since the problem statement specifies that you want to minimize "Energy," I will assume that you want to minimize the total energy used, which can be defined based on the coefficients for each food item.
#
#Here's the updated code:
#
#python
#Copy code
import pulp

# Create a linear programming problem
problem = pulp.LpProblem("Minimize_Energy", pulp.LpMinimize)

# Define decision variables
CVTP = pulp.LpVariable('CVTP', lowBound=0)  # Continuous variable for CVTP
CHKN = pulp.LpVariable('CHKN', lowBound=0)  # Continuous variable for CHKN
RICE = pulp.LpVariable('RICE', lowBound=0)  # Continuous variable for RICE
SLMN = pulp.LpVariable('SLMN', lowBound=0)  # Continuous variable for SLMN
MASH = pulp.LpVariable('MASH', lowBound=0)  # Continuous variable for MASH

# Objective function: Minimize total energy
problem += (440 * CVTP + 690 * CHKN + 580 * RICE + 660 * SLMN + 500 * MASH), "Total_Energy"

# Constraints
problem += (980 * CVTP + 920 * CHKN + 880 * RICE + 850 * SLMN + 770 * MASH <= 5000 * 7, "Sodium_Constraint")
problem += (29 * CVTP + 41 * CHKN + 34 * RICE + 37 * SLMN + 41 * MASH >= 50 * 7, "Protein_Constraint")
problem += (0.0 * CVTP + 0.1 * CHKN + 0.1 * RICE + 11.2 * SLMN + 0.1 * MASH >= 20 * 7, "VitaminD_Constraint")
problem += (160 * CVTP + 380 * CHKN + 130 * RICE + 110 * SLMN + 100 * MASH >= 1300 * 7, "Calcium_Constraint")
problem += (2.2 * CVTP + 1.8 * CHKN + 3.5 * RICE + 1.3 * SLMN + 2.5 * MASH >= 18 * 7, "Iron_Constraint")
problem += (930 * CVTP + 980 * CHKN + 1010 * RICE + 910 * SLMN + 1430 * MASH >= 4700 * 7, "Potassium_Constraint")

# Solve the problem
problem.solve()

# Output the results
print("Status:", pulp.LpStatus[problem.status])
print("Optimal Energy:", pulp.value(problem.objective))
print("CVTP:", CVTP.varValue)
print("CHKN:", CHKN.varValue)
print("RICE:", RICE.varValue)
print("SLMN:", SLMN.varValue)
print("MASH:", MASH.varValue)
#Explanation of Changes:
#Objective Function: The objective function has been changed to minimize the total energy consumption instead of the total cost. The coefficients from the energy constraint are used here.
#
#Removed Total Cost: The total cost variable is not included in the objective function anymore, focusing solely on minimizing energy.
#
#Constraints: The constraints remain the same to ensure that all dietary requirements are still satisfied.
#
#You can run this code in a Python environment, and it will output the optimal solution for minimizing energy while satisfying the constraints.
